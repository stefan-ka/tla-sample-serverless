# Three Letter Abbreviations (TLA) Sample Application - Implemented Serverless
[![Build and deploy main branch](https://github.com/OST-Cloud-Application-Lab/tla-sample-serverless/actions/workflows/main_build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OST-Cloud-Application-Lab/tla-sample-serverless/actions/workflows/main_build.yml) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This repository implements the [Three Letter Abbreviations (TLA) Sample Application](https://github.com/ContextMapper/ddd-cm-tla-sample-application) of the [Context Mapper](https://contextmapper.org) project with serverless technology. It can easily be deployed on AWS. The app illustrates basic CRUD operations using the following AWS services:

![TLA Sample App - Implemented Serverless](./docs/images/TLA-Sample-App-Serverless.jpg)

 * **Amazon API Gateway** now serves the RESTful HTTP API to access the TLA's.
 * **AWS Lambda** is used (one function per endpoint) to process the request events of the API gateway, load the data from a DynamoDB table and return a response event back to the gateway.
 * **Amazon DynamoDB** is used to persist the TLA's.

## Used Technology

The app uses the following tools and frameworks:

 * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build the app deployable (JAR)
 * [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Spring Cloud Function](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function) to implement the functions.
 * The [AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html) to connect to the DynamoDB.
 * The [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to deploy the whole application on AWS.
   * Including the definition of the API endpoints and the DynamoDB table; see the [serverless.yml](https://github.com/OST-Cloud-Application-Lab/tla-sample-serverless/blob/main/serverless.yml) file. 
 * [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/OST-Cloud-Application-Lab/tla-sample-serverless/actions) as CI/CD tool to automatically deploy the app to AWS.

## Build and Deploy the App

Building the app and its JAR file is done with Maven:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

The command above creates a JAR file `target\tla-sample-serverless-1.2-SNAPSHOT-aws.jar` which contains all the functions (lambdas) of the app. Once successfully built, the app is easily deployed with:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

_Note:_ `serverless deploy` only works if you have already set up the serverless framework locally, including logging in and connecting to your AWS account. See the [Serverless Framework documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) for more information on how to do this.

Once `serverless deploy` was successful, you can fill the DynamoDB table with some sample data by executing our `seed_database` function. You can do this via the following command:

```bash
sls invoke --function seed_database --data 'unused'
```

Now you can access the TLA's via the apps API: ðŸŽ‰

## Use Cases and Endpoints
The application currently supports the following use cases, for which we provide some sample CURLs. There is also a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection in the `docs` folder.

_Disclaimer:_ Please note that we haven't implemented any identity and access control measures for this sample application. All endpoints are publicly available; including the writing ones (commands). 

_Note_ that you will need to replace `{baseUrl}` with the URLs you get from `sls deploy` in all the following examples.

| Endpoint                        | Method | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| /tlas?status=PROPOSED           | GET    | Get TLAs in PROPOSED state.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| /tlas                           | POST   | Create a new TLA group (see sample payload below). Containing TLAs will be in PROPOSED state.                                                                                                 |
| /tlas/{groupName}               | GET    | Get all TLAs of a specific group.                                                                                                                                                             |
| /tlas/{groupName}               | POST   | Create a new TLA within an existing group (see sample payload below). The created TLA will be in PROPOSED state.                                                                              |
| /tlas/all/{name}                | GET    | Search for a TLA over all groups. This query can return multiple TLAs as a single TLA is only unique within one group.                                                                        |
| /tlas/{groupName}/{name}/accept | PUT    | Accept a proposed TLA ([state transition operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/StateTransitionOperation): PROPOSED -> ACCEPTED). |

### Get All TLA Groups
The `/tlas` (GET) endpoint returns all TLAs of all TLA groups that are in the `ACCEPTED` state (read on to see how to propose and accept new TLAs). Note that all TLAs are part of a group.

**CURL**: `curl -X GET {baseUrl}/tlas`

**Sample output:**

```json
[
    {
        "name":"common",
        "description":"Common TLA group",
        "tlas":[
            {
                "name":"TLA",
                "meaning":"Three Letter Abbreviation",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                    "Three Letter Acronym"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name":"AppArch",
        "description":"Application Architecture",
        "tlas":[
            {
                "name":"ADR",
                "meaning":"Architectural Decision Record",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                ],
                "link":"https://adr.github.io/"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name":"DDD",
        "description":"Domain-Driven Design",
        "tlas":[
            {
                "name":"ACL",
                "meaning":"Anticorruption Layer",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                ]
            },
            {
                "name":"CF",
                "meaning":"Conformist",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                ]
            },
            {
                "name":"OHS",
                "meaning":"Open Host Service",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                ]
            },
            {
                "name":"PL",
                "meaning":"Published Language",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                ]
            },
            {
                "name":"SK",
                "meaning":"Shared Kernel",
                "alternativeMeanings":[
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Note that the endpoint returns all TLAs in state `ACCEPTED` by default. Use the query parameter `status` with the value `PROPOSED` to list TLAs in the `PROPOSED` state (see example below under "Query Proposed TLAs").

### Get TLAs of a Specific Group
The endpoint `/tlas/{groupName}` (GET) returns all TLAs of a specific group.

**Sample CURL**: `curl -X GET {baseUrl}/tlas/DDD`

**Sample output:**

```json
{
    "name": "DDD",
    "description": "Domain-Driven Design",
    "tlas": [
        {
            "name": "ACL",
            "meaning": "Anticorruption Layer",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        },
        {
            "name": "CF",
            "meaning": "Conformist",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        },
        {
            "name": "OHS",
            "meaning": "Open Host Service",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        },
        {
            "name": "PL",
            "meaning": "Published Language",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        },
        {
            "name": "SK",
            "meaning": "Shared Kernel",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        }
    ]
}
```

### Search TLA in All Groups
With the endpoint `/tlas/all/{name}` (GET) you can search for a TLA through all groups. Note that this might return multiple results, as TLAs are only unique within one group.

**Sample CURL**: `curl -X GET {baseUrl}/tlas/all/ACL`

**Sample output:**

```json
[
    {
        "name": "DDD",
        "description": "Domain-Driven Design",
        "tlas": [
            {
                "name": "ACL",
                "meaning": "Anticorruption Layer",
                "alternativeMeanings": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Create new TLA Group
Via `/tlas` (POST) you can create a new TLA group.

**Sample CURL 1 (without containing TLA)**:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ "name": "FIN", "description": "Finance TLAs", "tlas": [] }' \
  {baseUrl}/tlas
```

**Sample CURL 2 (with containing TLA)**: 
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ "name": "FIN", "description": "Finance TLAs", "tlas": [ { "name": "ROI", "meaning": "Return on Investment", "alternativeMeanings": [] } ] }' \
  {baseUrl}/tlas
```

**Sample output:** (created group is returned)

```json
{
    "name": "FIN",
    "description": "Finance TLAs",
    "tlas": [
        {
            "name": "ROI",
            "meaning": "Return on Investment",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the new TLA is now in state `PROPOSED` and not delivered by the endpoints mentioned above. They only return TLAs in state `ACCEPTED` by default. Use the following endpoint ("Accept a Proposed TLA") to accept a proposed TLA.

### Add New TLA to Existing Group
With the endpoint `/tlas/{groupName}` (POST) you can add a new TLA to an existing group.

**Sample CURL**:
```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ "name": "ETF", "meaning": "Exchange-Traded Fund", "alternativeMeanings": [] }' \
  {baseUrl}/tlas/FIN
```

**Sample output:** (updated group is returned)

```json
{
    "name": "FIN",
    "description": "Finance TLAs",
    "tlas": [
        {
            "name": "ETF",
            "meaning": "Exchange-Traded Fund",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        },
        {
            "name": "ROI",
            "meaning": "Return on Investment",
            "alternativeMeanings": []
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that the new TLA is now in state `PROPOSED` and not delivered by the endpoints mentioned above. They only return TLAs in state `ACCEPTED` by default. Use the following endpoint ("Accept a Proposed TLA") to accept a proposed TLA.

### Query Proposed TLAs
The endpoint `/tlas` (GET) offers a query parameter to list all TLAs in the `PROPOSED` state: `/tlas?status=PROPOSED`

**Sample CURL**: `curl -X GET {baseUrl}/tlas?status=PROPOSED`

**Sample output:**

```json
[
    {
        "name": "FIN",
        "description": "Finance TLAs",
        "tlas": [
            {
                "name": "ETF",
                "meaning": "Exchange-Traded Fund",
                "alternativeMeanings": []
            },
            {
                "name": "ROI",
                "meaning": "Return on Investment",
                "alternativeMeanings": []
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Accept a Proposed TLA
With the endpoint `/tlas/{groupName}/{name}/accept` (PUT) you can accept a TLA ("name") within a group ("groupName"). This is a so-called [state transition operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/StateTransitionOperation).

**Sample CURL**: `curl -X PUT {baseUrl}/tlas/FIN/ROI/accept` (puts the TLA 'ROI' in group 'FIN' into state `ACCEPTED`)

This endpoint does not expect a body (JSON) and does also not return one. The command is successful if HTTP state 200 is returned.

Once the TLA is accepted, the query endpoints listed above (such as `/tlas` or `/tlas/{groupName}`) will now list them.
